Hello there! 
I have created this REST API web application using Core Java and Spring Framework. 
It encompasses features like adding a job, viewing the jobs, deleting jobs, searching by a specific keyword, etc. I have released the first version of it so it contains very basic features as of now.

TechStack used: Java, Spring Web, SpringBoot, Spring MVC, Data JPA, Postgre SQL, Apache Maven, Tomcat, Lombok.
